# This file contains utility functions for using Spotipy/Spotify API:
#   - auth_flow authenticates user
#   - get_token_header creates search header for artist querying
#   - capitalize_genre is a helper function to capitalize genres, including
#      common genre acronyms, in the succeeding search_for_artists function
#   - search_for_artists queries for specific artists and returns a df
#      containing important artist info (uri, popularity, genres, img url)
#   - retry_spotify_request is a helper function to retry Spotify API
#      requests in the following top_tracks function
#   - recommend_artists returns similar artists to those in playlist
#   - get_top_tracks gets the top 1-10 songs for each artist and returns a df
#      containing song metadata (uri, popularity, danceability, etc)
#   - create_playlist creates a new playlist for many songs
